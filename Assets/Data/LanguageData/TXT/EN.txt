Current situation report;
The suit is badly damaged, 95% of the data is lost. The ship is broken, flight is impossible. Location - unknown;
Environment Report 1;
The location is an unknown Earth-type planet. The atmosphere is breathable. Apparently - we are in the forest.;
Environment Report 2;
The result of the terrain analysis: We are in an unknown valley. The valley is formed by an unnatural mechanical way.;
Environmental Report 3;
The result of the analysis of constellations: The location of the planet is Sector D63. Distance to Earth - 43.51 light years.;
Environment Report 4;
Significant gravitational fluctuations have been detected. The source is presumably a white hole located underground.;
Analysis of an unknown structure;
The result of the analysis of an unknown structure: The material is unknown. The purpose is unknown. Weight - 215600t. Size and geometry - A cubic structure with a radius of 2-3 km. 99% of the structure is underground.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 1;
Most likely - we are faced with devices of a new alien species. Status - hostile. We were attacked not by the representatives of the species themselves, but by unknown robots, drones controlled from outside.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 2;
Drones are quite fragile and weak. Recommendation for use - to destroy.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 3;
It seems that this alien species has mastered the technologies of space warping.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 4;
Apparently they don't manage spatial distortions very well, sometimes their device makes mistakes and moves objects from human military and prod. warehouse.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 5;
The fact that they randomly move objects from our warehouses here is almost close to zero. Consequently, they somehow interact with our warehouses, moving something of their own there.;
Analysis of unknown opponents 6;
Everything suggests that humanity has been attacked by these creatures. And we, by a "lucky" chance, got here and crashed, right behind enemy lines.;
Environment Report 5;
At the opposite end of the valley, an entrance to an unknown structure of enormous size was discovered. It seems that this is their main complex, from where the space warps are produced.;
The secret is found!;
