I tried to create the game of my dreams. 

The game took a year and a half to develop, and I worked on it alone. As a result, I have created two demo levels where you can see most of the work done.

The game was developed without the use of thirdâ€”party resources - almost all the graphics, shaders, code, models and much more were created by me manually. 

Overall, it was a rewarding, if somewhat painful experience, as the game's development was never completed.
